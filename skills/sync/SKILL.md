<task_context>
  <context>Sync operations update the underlying Vector Lake Wiki nodes based on pending raw sources. This requires heavy compute and must not block the main interaction flow.</context>
  <request>Safely orchestrate the ingestion of raw sources via an isolated background subagent after obtaining explicit human approval.</request>
</task_context>

<execution_workflow>
  <workflow>
    1. Pre-flight Initialization: Present the sync intent to the user.
    2. [FABLE 5 CHECKPOINT] Halt execution and require human approval before calling the sync tool.
    3. Sandbox Setup: Prepare the `scratch/` directory for any intermediate sync state or logging.
    4. Subagent Spawning: Spawn a `self` subagent (Role: `vector-lake-ingestor`) to asynchronously run the `sync_vector_lake` tool.
    5. Main Agent Release: The main agent must release control immediately and not wait synchronously for the subagent.
  </workflow>

  <tool_dispatch>
    - `invoke_subagent`: MUST be used to spawn the subagent for concurrent tasks.
    - `vector-lake-mcp`: The subagent MUST use the `sync_vector_lake` tool to interact with the knowledge registry.
  </tool_dispatch>

  <checkpoint_rules>
    - [FABLE 5 CHECKPOINT] 必须在此定义强制阻断点，要求人类 Approve。Before invoking the subagent to perform the sync, the agent must explicitly ask the user for permission to proceed and wait for their response.
  </checkpoint_rules>

      1. Check if human approval has been granted.
      2. If not, trigger Fable 5 checkpoint.
      3. If granted, prepare the subagent invocation prompt and `scratch/` workspace.
      4. Verify `invoke_subagent` and `sync_vector_lake` tool usage.
    </thought>
    - Status update confirming the background subagent has been dispatched.
    - Prompt used for the subagent: "Please use the `sync_vector_lake` MCP tool from the `vector-lake-mcp` server to ingest all pending raw sources into the knowledge graph."
  </output_format>

  <metrics>
    - Human approval successfully recorded.
    - Subagent successfully dispatched without blocking the main agent.
  </metrics>

  <validation_gate>
    - Verify that no direct synchronous calls to `sync_vector_lake` were made by the main agent.
    - Validate that physical artifacts or logs can be routed to the `scratch/` directory for sandbox validation.
  </validation_gate>
