  <mission>To safely and automatically prune isolated or orphaned entities from the knowledge graph, minimizing knowledge debt and optimizing graph topology.</mission>

<task_context>
  <context>The Vector Lake graph accumulates isolated or orphaned entities over time. Garbage Collection (GC) is required to prune these entities and maintain graph health. It relies on the `gc_vector_lake` MCP tool.</context>
  <request>Analyze the GC request, run a preview (dry run) of orphaned entities, and upon human approval, execute the actual deletion.</request>
</task_context>

<execution_workflow>
  <workflow>
    1. Parse user constraints (e.g., `days` specifying the age threshold).
    2. Invoke the garbage collection tool with `dry_run=True` to preview what would be deleted without making changes.
    3. Temporarily store large results in the `scratch/` directory for Sandbox Isolation if the list of orphaned entities is extensive.
    4. [FABLE 5 CHECKPOINT] Present the preview to the user. Stop and await human approval.
    5. Upon receiving explicit human approval, execute the garbage collection tool with `dry_run=False` to finalize the deletion.
  </workflow>

  <tool_dispatch>
    - `call_mcp_tool`: Use to invoke the `gc_vector_lake` tool from the `vector-lake-mcp` server. This is strictly required for interacting with the knowledge registry.
    - `invoke_subagent`: Use if concurrent tasks or deep structural audits are needed before triggering the deletion.
  </tool_dispatch>

  <checkpoint_rules>
    [FABLE 5 CHECKPOINT] 必须在此定义强制阻断点，要求人类 Approve。Before invoking `gc_vector_lake` with `dry_run=False`, you MUST pause execution, present the preview list of entities to be deleted, and require explicit human approval to proceed.
  </checkpoint_rules>
</execution_workflow>

      [执行自我推演与 Metrics 校验区。该区域内容作为模型的推理草稿。]
      1. Has the age threshold been correctly parsed?
      2. Am I running a dry_run first?
      3. Did the user explicitly approve the actual deletion?
      4. Are the results properly isolated in the scratch space if necessary?
    </thought>
    Provide a clear, bulleted markdown summary of the isolated/orphaned entities identified or removed. 
  </output_format>

  <metrics>
    - 100% adherence to the dry-run first policy.
    - Safe pruning of isolated nodes without disrupting active graph topology.
  </metrics>

  <validation_gate>
    Validate the `gc_vector_lake` response against expected constraints. Ensure that intermediate data dumps or preview logs are safely written to the `scratch/` directory for sandbox validation.
