"""Parity guard for the Rust block extractor that now feeds claim extraction.

Every fixture here is a semantic rule that the port had to reproduce, and each one was a measured
divergence at some point (see CHANGELOG 2026-09-25):

* a blockquote is never entered by mistune's walk, so nothing inside it is a claim;
* only items of a *top-level* list emit a block -- a nested item's text belongs to its parent item;
* a code block contributes one space and none of its contents;
* a soft break becomes a space, a hard break becomes **nothing** (mistune emits the token
  ``linebreak`` for a hard break, which the Python walk's ``("softbreak", "hardbreak")`` check does
  not match);
* a heading nested in a list or blockquote does not move ``current_heading``.

`text` is not compared: it is produced by the same unchanged Python cleaner from `raw_text`.
