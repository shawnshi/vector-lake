"""The rebuild's safety property changed from exclusion to a snapshot fence.

The previous contract was mutual exclusion: the projection read, the staging and the publish
were one transaction, so a writer on another connection was refused for the whole rebuild.
Measured on the live corpus 2026-09-19, that was 436 s of the 465 s rebuild (94 %), which made a
routine maintenance step an availability event -- the outbox drain stalled behind it twice on
2026-09-18 and logged lock failures for ten minutes.

The new contract keeps the exactness that the single transaction was there for, using a fence
instead of a lock: every staged document records a digest of the bytes it was read from, and the
publish drops a change marker only when the document still digests identically.  A document
written during the rebuild keeps its marker, so ``gram_index_usable()`` stays false and the read
path refuses to serve -- the same honest degradation, without blocking writers.
