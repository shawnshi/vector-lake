"""The package must have no module-level import cycle.

An audit of this repository reported five import cycles around ``wiki_utils``, the
highest fan-in module (30 importers), and read them as layering fragility.  Measured
with an AST walk that separates module-level imports from function-level ones, the
number of cycles at **load time** is zero:

* every one of those five was an SCC computed over the union of module-level and
  function-level edges, i.e. a *conceptual* inversion, not an import defect;
* the package stays loadable because the edges that point "up" the layering are
  deferred to function scope, and they are the only reason it is loadable.

Only two pairs are genuinely bidirectional -- ``wiki_utils`` and ``db_store`` each
reach up through exactly one function into a module that imports them at module level:

    wiki_utils.write_markdown_file        -> mutation_coordinator.execute_mutation_plan
    db_store.delete_node_cascade          -> tool_timeline.sync_timeline_events_for_claim_delta

Neither is an accident that a later cleanup should hoist.  ``wiki_utils`` delegates its
writes to the coordinator so the write gate cannot be bypassed by calling the low-level
helper directly, and the deferral is what makes the delegation expressible at all.
For the timeline pair, the deferred binding is also load-bearing for fault injection:
``tests/test_timeline_projection.py`` monkeypatches ``tool_timeline``'s binding to
simulate a projection failure and asserts the canonical transaction rolls back, which
only intercepts the call because the caller resolves the name at call time.

So the invariant worth pinning is not "no upward edges" -- that would mean an invasive
re-layering of a 30-importer module for no measured defect -- but "no cycle at load
time".

What this guard does and does not buy, measured rather than assumed: hoisting
``wiki_utils``'s deferred import to module level does not merely trip this check, it
makes the package unimportable -- a five-module SCC
(``db_store -> defense_hook -> mutation_coordinator -> purpose_contract -> wiki_utils``)
and ``ImportError: cannot import name ... from partially initialized module``.  Because
``tests/conftest.py`` imports the package, that also makes the whole suite fail at
collection, so this check is **not** what would prevent a cycle: the interpreter already
fails loudly and first.

Its value is narrower and still real.  It reads files and never imports the package, so
it runs in exactly the state where nothing else can (demonstrated by running it through
``importlib`` on a deliberately broken tree), and it names the offending SCC instead of
leaving a cryptic partially-initialized-module chain.  The test below keeps that claim
honest by requiring the checker to detect a synthetic cycle.

Boundary, stated honestly: the walk covers ``vector_lake/*.py`` only.  Import cycles
involving ``scripts/``, the root entry points, or a third-party package are outside it,
and the check covers ``import``/``from ... import`` statements only -- it does not see
imports performed through ``importlib``.
