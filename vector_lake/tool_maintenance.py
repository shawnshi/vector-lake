"""Operator-facing wrappers for the two bounded repair paths.

``backup_retention.prune_backups`` and ``db_store.repair_idempotency_keys`` both
answer "what would change" before they change anything, and neither acts until it
is told to.  These wrappers keep that contract at the surface: the CLI's
``--apply`` and the MCP tool's ``dry_run`` flag are the only route to the mutating
branch, and the returned text always states whether anything actually changed.

They live here rather than inside ``backup_retention`` / ``db_store`` so the repair
logic stays free of presentation, and rather than inside ``cli_app`` /
``mcp_server`` so both surfaces report identically.

# --- claim pointer reconciliation -------------------------------------------

# operator's own SQL -- and the tables that *point at* claims then keep the dead pointer.
# Two such surfaces exist and neither had a reader that would notice:
#
#   * ``evidence.supports_claim_ids`` / ``contradicts_claim_ids`` name claim ids.  Measured on
#     the live corpus: 25 220 of 84 606 pointers name a claim that no longer exists, spread over
#     25 217 rows, and 25 214 of them were created in one bulk event on 2026-07-14 -- the count
#     has not moved since (25 221 at the 2026-09-22 snapshot).
#   * ``claim_graph_edges`` stores page keys.  The delta's delete filtered this table by *claim*
#     ids, which matched nothing there, so every rewritten page kept its retired links.
#
# The timeline projection has had a parity gate and a repair since it broke; these two did not.
# Both entry points are read-only until ``--apply``.
