"""Exact n-gram inverted index over ``operational_memory_index``.

Why this exists
---------------

``search_operational_memory`` scores a memory by counting how many query terms
occur in its key / text / page fields, weighted 4 / 3 / 1.  ``_query_terms``
expands a CJK query into *every single character* plus *every adjacent bigram*,
so a 30-character question becomes ~59 terms and the plain SQL form of the
scorer needs ``O(rows x terms)`` ``instr()`` calls: measured 2.3 s on the live
142 117-row corpus, growing linearly forever.

An inverted index turns that into ``O(sum of the postings of the query terms)``.
Measured on the same corpus, the longest realistic query touches 223 253
postings and accumulates in 0.12 s *in pure Python* -- no numpy, no compression
dependency.

Layout
------

``operational_memory_gram(gram, postings)``
    The base index.  ``postings`` is a little-endian ``uint32`` array where each
    element is ``(doc_delta << 4) | field_mask``; ``doc_delta`` is the gap to the
    previous document so the list stays sorted and compact, and ``field_mask``
    has bit 0 = key, bit 1 = text, bit 2 = page.  Measured 414 914 distinct grams
    and 25 430 371 postings = 97 MB, against 162 MB for the dead FTS projection
    this replaced.  A posting list averages 61 entries, so decoding is cheap.

``operational_memory_gram_overlay(gram, doc, mask)`` -- **dropped**
    This table let an older release's incremental step put a document's postings in two
    structures at once, which the read path summed as if the overlay replaced the base:
    a document could be credited for a gram it no longer contained.  Nothing wrote it
    after the incremental path was removed (see the correctness section), so the table
    and every reader of it are gone; the schema prune that drops it is recorded in
    ``db_store._LEGACY_SCHEMA_PRUNES`` so existing databases converge too.

``operational_memory_gram_dirty(doc)``
    Documents whose base postings cannot be trusted.  A dirty document is skipped
    outright, so its stale base entries credit nothing, and a deleted document -- which
    has no projection row and therefore no way to be listed -- is skipped the same way.
    Skipping is *all* that happens: a document leaves this queue only when a rebuild
    replaces the base, which is why the index reports itself unusable while a live
    document is queued.

Correctness
-----------

The index reproduces :func:`governance_store._memory_relevance` exactly:
``relevance = sum over terms of 4*[term in key] + 3*[term in text] + [term in page]``.
Terms of one or two characters are looked up directly.  Longer terms are
resolved by intersecting the postings of their constituent bigrams (a necessary
condition) and then verifying each candidate with ``instr``, so the result is
exact too.  ``tests/test_memory_gram_index.py`` asserts equality with the
``legacy`` full-scan oracle.

#: Bumped when a previously written base can no longer be trusted to be exact.
#: Version 1 is not: a database drained by the release that shipped it can hold no
#: live queue entry over a base that is missing a document's current grams *and* still
#: posting grams it dropped, which is indistinguishable from a clean base by counters
#: alone.  Raising the version turns every such database into a visible ``ready=False``
#: and one rebuild.
GRAM_FORMAT_VERSION = 2

#: Gram *groups* packed per committed chunk in the rebuild's second pass.  Groups are whole, so
#: the chunk is bounded by the primary-key range and a commit never straddles one.
PACK_CHUNK_GRAMS = 5_000
#: Largest corpus rebuilt automatically on the read path.  The cap has nothing to do
#: with how much is queued: a base that is *stale* is never rebuilt from a read, no
#: matter how small, because the exact scan is far cheaper than a rebuild for any
#: corpus this cap admits -- at the 3 ms/document rebuild cost below, a 2 000-document
#: corpus is ~6 s to rebuild against ~32 ms to scan, so a read-path rebuild would have
#: to be amortised over ~190 searches per write.  Only a missing base (never built, a
#: truncated table, or an older format version) is built on first use, where there is
#: nothing to serve and the alternative is failing every search.
#:
#: It also bounds how long a *reader* can refuse writers.  The build runs in one
#: transaction, so a first-use build holds the write lock for its whole duration and a
#: concurrent writer fails closed once ``db_store.BEGIN_LOCK_BUDGET_SECONDS`` (20 s)
#: elapses.  At the cost above a 2 000-document build is ~6 s, which stays inside that
#: budget; raising this cap raises what a writer has to wait for, not only what a search
#: costs.
AUTO_REBUILD_MAX_DOCS = 2_000
#: Documents written since the last rebuild at which the index is due for one.
#:
#: Measured on the live lake (146 679 documents, 2026-09-18): the indexed path answers a
#: search in 0.295 s median against 0.745 s for the exact scan, so restoring it saves
#: ~0.355 s per search -- while one rebuild costs ~430 s and refuses **every** writer for
#: its duration.  A rebuild therefore only pays for itself after ~1 200 searches, and the
#: number that decides this constant is not that break-even but how long a rebuild may
#: stop writes: writes are the shared resource, and no amount of saved search time buys
#: back an ingest that failed against a 20 s lock budget.  So rebuilds stay rare
#: deliberately, and the threshold is set by tolerated staleness rather than by search
#: savings.  At the observed write rate (~tens of documents a day) 500 means one rebuild
#: every few weeks; each one costs that 430 s window once.
#:
#: This is a *maintenance* trigger, never a read-path one:
#: :func:`ensure_memory_gram_index` leaves a stale base alone at any size, and only
#: :func:`maybe_rebuild_memory_gram_index` -- the scheduled block in the watchdog and
#: ``gram-index --if-due`` -- settles the debt.
REBUILD_AFTER_WRITES = 500

#: Cost basis for the amortisation branch of :func:`rebuild_due_reason`.
#:
#: Both numbers are measured on this corpus (2026-09-25), and both have moved since
#: :data:`REBUILD_AFTER_WRITES` was chosen:
#:
#: * a rebuild now costs **~77 s** (staging 58.0 + pack 16.5 + publish 2.0) on 69 929 documents;
#:   the ~430 s the older note cites belongs to a 146 679-document corpus;
#: * the indexed path saves **~0.46 s per memory search** (782 ms indexed against 1 240 ms on the
#:   exact projected scan, same day and corpus).
#:
#: So one rebuild is repaid after roughly **166 searches**, not the ~1 200 the write-count note
#: implies.  A write count cannot express that: it fires on churn instead of on debt incurred.  Its
#: visible failure: until 2026-09-25 the only caller was the 10:00/23:00 occurrence, so a churny
#: day left every memory search on the slow path for up to 13 hours -- measured that day: 9 212
#: live dirty documents, memory retrieval 1 240 ms instead of 782 ms.
