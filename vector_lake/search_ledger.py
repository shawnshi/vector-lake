"""What search answered, recorded so a ranking change can be measured against a baseline.

The A1/A2 work changes which candidates reach ``top_k``, and the lake keeps no record that could
show whether it improved: there is no ``log.md`` and no query table.  This writes one JSON line per
retrieval -- enough to compare two runs that must agree, and to see which of FTS, the vector
projection or graph expansion actually produced each page.

The query text is **not** stored.  It is caller content, it is not this module's to retain, and a
digest answers the two questions the ledger exists for: "is this the same query as last time" and
"is the same query answering differently than it did".  ``query_chars`` is kept because a digest
alone cannot distinguish a short query from a long one when reading the file by eye.

Bounded and fail-open.  The ledger is a measurement: it must never make a search fail, and it must
not grow without limit.  One generation is rotated aside at ``MAX_BYTES``, so the ceiling is 2x.
