"""Retention for ``mutation_outbox``: free the payload weight, keep the dedup record.

Measured 2026-09-25 on the live lake: 41 787 rows, of which 41 679 ``completed`` and 108
``superseded``, holding **79.6 MB** of ``payload_text`` (every row carries the page content it wrote),
going back to 2026-07-12.  Nothing pruned it.

Why this nulls the payload instead of deleting the row -- three readers depend on the row itself:

* ``enqueue_mutation`` matches ``idempotency_key`` against **terminal** rows and *revives* the match
  (``status='pending'`` with the new payload) rather than inserting a second row.  Deleting old rows
  would turn a repeated logical write into a second mutation;
* ``is_managed_projection_state`` takes the latest row for a filename and compares its payload to
  decide whether an incoming filesystem event is the daemon's own write (echo suppression).  The row
  must exist; only rows older than the window lose their payload, and by then the latest row for any
  file actually being written is a fresher one;
* ``_ensure_idempotency_index`` builds its unique index over *non-terminal* states only, so a
  retention sweep cannot collide with it.  Nothing here touches a non-terminal row.

``payload_text`` is the only column with real weight (filename/idempotency_key/status/timestamps are
small), so nulling it recovers essentially all of the 79.6 MB while leaving the ledger's meaning
intact.  The space lands on SQLite's freelist -- ``auto_vacuum=0`` here, so the file only shrinks
when :func:`vector_lake.db_store.reclaim_free_space` runs.
