"""One place that answers, for every derived projection: is it healthy, and what repairs it?

Why this exists: on 2026-09-25 five separate incidents landed on the same root cause -- the lake keeps
a *lot* of derived indices (FTS5, the operational-memory gram index, the vector projection, tantivy,
the page projection, the claim index, the timeline index, governance), and each one had its own idea
of what "healthy" means, its own repair entry point, and its own way of degrading.  The symptoms were
all log lines: a search quietly taking the exact projected scan for 13 hours, 501 missing vectors
after a mass edit, an FTS switch that was inert on the path that mattered.

This module does not add a ninth mechanism.  It gives the existing health checks and repair entry
points **one shape**: ``Projection(name, authority, cost, health, repair)``, plus ``status()`` and
``reconcile()`` over them.  A projection's health is a fact with a detail string, not a sentence in a
log; its repair is a callable, not a script name in a comment.

Pilots registered here (2026-09-25): the operational-memory gram index and the vector projection --
the two this session had to repair by hand.  The remaining projections are **not migrated yet**;
until they are, this is a reporting and reconciliation surface for those two, and the honest next step
is one projection per change with its own test.
