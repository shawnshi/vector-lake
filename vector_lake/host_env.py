"""Host-runtime path conventions.

Vector Lake has no host adapter layer: the runtime recognises four environment
variables and otherwise falls back to the home directories of the hosts it has
historically been installed into.  Those fallbacks used to be literals spread
across four modules; they live here so that adding a host is a one-module change
and so that the precedence is testable.

Nothing in this module may import ``vector_lake`` at module scope: it is part of
the base layer and is imported by ``wiki_utils``.
