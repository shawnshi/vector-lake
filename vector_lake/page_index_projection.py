"""SQLite projection of ``index.json`` for the read paths.

``index.json`` stays the sovereign, portable artifact: it is what an operator can
inspect, diff and ship.  But it is one document, so every reader had to parse the
whole thing and rebuild derived structures from scratch:

* ``_search_scored_pages`` parsed the file once per process (18 MB / 0.2 s on the
  live 7 178-node corpus, and the parsed dict is a much larger object graph), and
  rebuilt a 30 140-edge undirected adjacency dict on *every* query;
* ``assemble_context`` re-parsed the whole file to render a 50-line summary;
* at 10^5 nodes the file is the dominant read cost and the in-memory dict is the
  dominant memory cost.

This module projects what the read paths consume into SQLite:

``page_index_nodes``
    One row per node: the filter columns as real columns plus ``node_json`` for
    full fidelity, because ``filter_expr`` is a caller-supplied expression over
    arbitrary node fields.  Read paths fetch only the keys they actually need, so
    the 7 178-node dict never has to exist in memory.

``page_index_edges``
    ``weighted_edges`` with an explicit ``sequence`` column.  It is the only database
    projection of that set -- a second table used to mirror it, was removed on 2026-09-18 because
    nothing read it -- and it derives from the published file, which is the source.  The sequence
    preserves ``index.json``'s edge
    order, which the two-step personalised PageRank walk is sensitive to.
    The undirected adjacency is built once per process and reused.

``page_index_state``
    ``(index_mtime, index_size)`` of the ``index.json`` this projection was built
    from, so an out-of-band rewrite is detected with one ``stat`` instead of a
    parse, and the projection repairs itself.

    The file is the sovereign artifact, so it can always answer a read: a reader
    that finds the projection behind does not have to take the write lock to
    rebuild it in order to return results that the file already contains -- and
    contains more up to date.

    Built per request and dropped with it.  The module docstring's objection to
    parsing the whole file stands (169 MB / ~1.9 s on the live corpus), but the
    alternative for a stale projection was no answer at all, and caching the
    object graph in a long-lived server is the cost this projection exists to
    avoid.  The edge walk is lazy: queries whose top hits produce no seeds never
    pay for it.
