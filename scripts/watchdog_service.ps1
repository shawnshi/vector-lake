<#
Vector Lake watchdog wrapper for the scheduled task "VectorLake-Watchdog".

Why this exists: ``watchdog_sync.py`` is a foreground process whose only log sink is stderr,
and Task Scheduler cannot redirect it. This wrapper owns exactly one start -- it pins the
working directory to the repository root, resolves the interpreter, pins UTF-8 so Chinese
page names survive in the log, and then runs the watchdog in the foreground until it exits.

The task's repetition trigger runs with MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew, so it only starts a new
wrapper after the previous one returned: one running watchdog, and a bounded relaunch after a
crash or a hard kill. The watchdog itself keeps exactly one instance through
``.meta/.watchdog.instance.lock``, so a manual double start is rejected, not duplicated.

# Interactive latency trigger for the memory n-gram index.
#
# The write-count threshold (500 documents) is a *write-lock* budget, not a latency budget: it
# decides how often a rebuild may stop writers, and it ignores that a stale index turns every
# memory-backed query into an O(rows x terms) scan.  Measured 2026-09-29 on the live lake: 458
# dirty documents sat below that threshold, the read path had switched the indexed path off, and
# nothing was scheduled to fix it -- every affected query paid ~0.5 s (rebuild afterwards took
# ``assemble_context`` from 669.9 ms to 63.2 ms).
#
# 20 searches is deliberately far below the ~166-search machine-time break-even: this host serves a
# human, so user-visible latency outranks aggregate CPU time, while 20 still bounds rebuild churn to
# roughly one rebuild per 20 searches.  Export the variable yourself (including ``0``) to override;
# the guard below only supplies the default.
